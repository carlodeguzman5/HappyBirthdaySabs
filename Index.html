			Allo allo Sabs! Happy Birthday AMC Classmate. AHAHAHAHA Kung hindi ako siguro naging packman, probs, hindi kita masyadong makakausap in AMC... hahahaha So I am very thankful that I did become a Packman and if I remember correctly, naging package manager ako for Batman because of a different reason AHAHHAHAHAHAHA alam mo na... but anyway moving. Thank you for letting me plan all of those baking and cooking days sa bahay mo kahit wala dapat akong karapatan AHAHAHA It was a lot of fun~ Looking back, ang dami nating achievements from the fun things to different projects~ hahaha memories namimiss ka na namin, habang ika'y nasa London hahaha babalik ka pa naman AHAHAHAHA~ It makes me excited to think of what we might do when you get back AHHAHAA baka matuloy na yung Out of the country bit that we planned before before pa hahaha who knows? :)) Sige sige :))) Well it's not like we're not going to see each other again, saka may facebook naman...

			Hi Sabs, happy birthday!! I hope you're having fun in London and living the study-abroad dream hehe. I don't know how you mustered up the strength to go through having another thesis to prepare for but I'm sure you'll pull through regardless! Thanks for being one of my senior friends when I was a junior and for generally being a cool person to hang and drink with. See you soon!! :--)

			Good day po mamser!!

			HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY SABS!! Wherever you are right now I hope that you are content, happy, and that all is going well. I pray that you do great but even if not, at the very least, I hope that you are enjoying what you do because when you enjoy what you do, you let what you do be you. Galingan mo sa masters!

			And yes, nalaman ko na rin. I NEVER EXPECTED DAMN GIRL. But, I wish you both good luck and that you grow even more as man and woman with and for others. Consider me a fan!

			Sending you love here from the PH!
			RICH CHIGGA
